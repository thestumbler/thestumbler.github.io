*Lott Family Home on Hambaugh Terrace*
{% endcomment %}

For the first time in almost fifty years, there won’t be any Lotts living on
Hambaugh Terrace. In 1969, our parents took a risky plunge and moved into a big
but well-used house, situated on an unpaved and dusty dead-end road. It’s
going to be a sad day indeed when my brother Greg steps into the cab of his
fully-loaded, 1983 **Trailways passenger bus** this September. As
he waves goodbye for the last time, he will depart on a long journey to
**Alaska**, leaving behind nothing but decades of memories - and the neighbors
choking on white clouds of exhaust fumes.

My brother Greg has spoken before of someday moving to Alaska,
which I always took to be a pipe dream.  To my surprise, dream
became reality a few weeks ago. Needless to say, he is swamped
with moving preparations, so I have appointed myself *Chief Scribe and Chronicler*
of the "2018 Great Alaska Getaway".  In these pages, I will document
the trip with words, pictures, website links, etc., so friends
and family can follow his progress.  That said, Greg won't be
living in a vacuum, nor an igloo.  He will have telephone and
internet access throughout the majority of his journey, and can
be contacted directly by friends and family (*no enemies, please*)
if the situation warrants.
