After reviewing petabytes of data from long range scanners and robotic scouting 
drones, as well as consultations with local species, Eagle 83 decided on a change

the crew unanimously agreed to settle in North Pole!

*Not THIS North Pole*

In addition, the crew took a one day break from travelling to perform some 
preventative maintenance on Eagle 83.

Tomorrow the crew will embark on their final day of the journey.
