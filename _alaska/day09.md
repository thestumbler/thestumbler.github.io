Today was a momentous day for the Eagle 83 mission, as the crew
reached several milestones.

* They have now travelled over 50% of the total distance between Homewood, Alabama and Glennallen, Alaska. 
Specifically, 2265 miles out of 4365 have been covered (3645 km / 7020 km).
They have piloted the Eagle 83 the equivalent of 6 eight-hour days, and have just over 5 eight-hour-days remaining.

* They successfully passed inspection at the Canadian border with minor hassle.
BusCom Alex's had to leave behind his collection of 
[Mexican Jumping Beans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_jumping_bean){:target="_blank"}{% comment %}_{% endcomment %}
and
Captain Greg lost his set of
[jequirity-bean-filled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abrus_precatorius){:target="_blank"}{% comment %}_{% endcomment %}
[Maracas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maraca){:target="_blank"}{% comment %}_{% endcomment %}.
Organic matter on the bus windshield was initially
deemed to be
[poultry manure](http://www.fftimes.com/news/district/poultry-banned-border){:target="_blank"}{% comment %}_{% endcomment %},
which is prohibited.
This sticky issue was quickly solved by washing the windows.
Forty-five minutes later, the expedition was allowed into Canada.

* The bus also passed the L<sub>1</sub> 
[Lagrangian point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_point){:target="_blank"}{% comment %}_{% endcomment %},
where the gravitational pull of Alaska equals that of Alabama. From now on,
Alaska will be pulling Eagle 83 towards Glennallen with increasing force each
day.

Lots of mountains today, not surprising since they were passing near the
[Continental Divide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_Divide_of_the_Americas){:target="_blank"}{% comment %}_{% endcomment %}
and crossing the
[Rocky Mountains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocky_Mountain_Front){:target="_blank"}{% comment %}_{% endcomment %}.
Maximum elevation today was about 4600 feet (1400 m).
