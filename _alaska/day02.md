**Eagle 83, this is Command Post Kimchi, do you copy, over?**

*Banner photo today is of the Spring River at Mammoth Spring State Park  
at the Arkansas / Missouri border along US 63.*

Today's travels took Eagle 83 up and over the Salem Plateau of the 
[Ozark Mountains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozarks){:target="_blank"} {% comment %}_{% endcomment %},
requiring a change in altitude of about 1000 ft / 305 m.

Eagle 83 BusCom Alex reported that Captain Greg said, "Those hills were something else",
(paraphrased, in order to keep this blog family-friendly). Lunch was at a truck stop in 
[West Plains, Missouri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Plains,_Missouri){:target="_blank"} {% comment %}_{% endcomment %}, 
and then quickly back on the road. No time to linger.
They had a quick break around dinner time at a 
[Platte City, Missouri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platte_City,_Missouri){:target="_blank"} {% comment %}_{% endcomment %}
truck stop.

Here they met up with my longtime friend and colleague JohnW,
who was kind enough to bring them some Kansas City BBQ from his friend's restaurant, the
[Tin Kitchen](http://www.tin-kitchen.com){:target="_blank"} {% comment %}_{% endcomment %}.

Equipped with boxes of BBQ and local Kansas City brews, they quickly departed (no time to linger) and proceeded a bit further 
along the interstate.  They finally turned in for the night at
[Rock Port, Missouri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_Port,_Missouri){:target="_blank"}{% comment %}_{% endcomment %}
to enjoy the KC BBQ. Today they travelled in two states, Arkansas and Missouri.
It was longest day yet, although this is only day two.



## The Route

The route begin from last night's stopover, 
[Trumann, Arkansas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trumann,_Arkansas){:target="_blank"}{% comment %}_{% endcomment %}
and proceeded along 
[US 63](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Route_63){:target="_blank"} {% comment %}_{% endcomment %} and
[US 60](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Route_60){:target="_blank"} {% comment %}_{% endcomment %}
to [Springfield, Missouri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Springfield,_Missouri){:target="_blank"}{% comment %}_{% endcomment %}.
After the winding roads through the Ozarks, Greg was ready for some Interstate travel.
They deviated from the planned route, proceeded due west along
[I-44](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_44){:target="_blank"}{% comment %}_{% endcomment %}, 
where they picked up 
[I-49](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_49){:target="_blank"}{% comment %}_{% endcomment %}
northbound in
[Joplin, Missouri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joplin,_Missouri){:target="_blank"}{% comment %}_{% endcomment %}
to 
[metropolitan Kansas City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_metropolitan_area){:target="_blank"} {% comment %}_{% endcomment %}.
They took loop
[I-435](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_435){:target="_blank"}{% comment %}_{% endcomment %}
around the Missouri side of the city, breaking briefly for dinner in 
[Platte City, Missouri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platte_City,_Missouri){:target="_blank"} {% comment %}_{% endcomment %}.
After a quick stop at the 
[Quik Trip](https://www.findtruckservice.com/Semi/Truck+Stops/All+Truck+Stops/MO/Nevada/424495/Quik+Trip+%23236),
they proceeded along
[I-29](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_29){:target="_blank"}{% comment %}_{% endcomment %} northbound to 
[Rock Port, Missouri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_Port,_Missouri){:target="_blank"}{% comment %}_{% endcomment %},
where they spent the night.
Rock Port is the first city in the United States to be entirely powered by electric wind turbines.
Thus ends day two.
