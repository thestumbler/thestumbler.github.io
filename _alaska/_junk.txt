[Christopher Columbus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Columbus)
took seven years to prepare for his departure across the Atlantic Ocean.
[Capt. Meriwether Lewis and 2nd Lt. William Clark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_and_Clark_Expedition)
took only six months to prepare for their Expedition.
Greg took two months, and only missed his targeted departure date by a few days.
Not bad, in comparison.


I have put the route and waypoints into [Google Maps](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1QToP1iDFNB0dEk8pjlkAVyIr8ThzeEdh&usp=sharing)
Bookmark this map, and I will be updating the progress on this map each day.
