No details or photos from today, as Eagle 83 entered a communications blackout as they went around the
far side of planet Aishihik (pronounced like "big-fat-solid-rock"). Before entering the shadow of Aishihik, 
the crew communicated their progress, and will overnight at 
[Haines Junction, Yukon Territory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haines_Junction){:target="_blank"}{% comment %}_{% endcomment %}.
Hopefully photos and details will be added to this post tomorrow when the crew re-establishes communications.

It is not inconceivable that the crew will arrive in 
[Glennallen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glennallen,_Alaska){:target="_blank"}{% comment %}_{% endcomment %}
tomorrow, but certainly they can cross the Alaskan border and get to 
[Tok](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tok,_Alaska){:target="_blank"}{% comment %}_{% endcomment %}.
The travelling portion of the journey is finally winding down!


Stay tuned for weather data tomorrow.
I have accumulated the data, just pondering how best to present it
