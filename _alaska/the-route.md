As one might imagine, planning your route for a weekend outing is a lot
different than planning your route to Alaska. As I have learned from Greg, all
kinds of variables enter into the equation.  There are obvious things like avoid or
use toll roads, desired types of roads such as interstates, state highways, etc.
But when traveling by bus on a one-way journey to Alaska, the issues are mind-boggling.
Here are just some of the things that Greg has had to account for in his route
planning:

* *Road type:* Much more-so than in a car, in a 46-passenger bus you care a lot about the
  type and condition of roads traveled.  Special care must be taken in navigating through and 
  around cities.  
* *Height restrictions:*  You have to make sure your bus will have enough clearance for any
  tunnels and overpasses.
* *Propane restrictions:*  Some tunnels and bridges won't permit transit by vehicles carrying
  propane tanks.
* *Towing concerns*: You must be sure that a road or jurisdiction allows towing, and that towing is
  safe / possible.
* *Firearms*: Confirm the regulations of various jurisdiction and border crossings regarding
  your firearms (don't wanna get eaten by a bear on arrival in Alaska).
* *Ferries:* Your trip can be significantly shortened and your bank account possible drained 
  by the use of ferries, if allowed.  Must decide carefully.
* *Gas prices:*  Traveling in a diesel-fuel-guzzling vehicle like the Eagle coach, you 
  must consider the price of fuel, which may mean avoiding refueling in certain areas.
* *Sightseeing:* People don't have the chance to travel across the entire country often, and
  naturally it would be nice to visit various sights of interest along the way.
* *Lodging:* Do you want to stay in a hotel or campground?  Walmart parking lots? Which places
  can even accept a huge bus, what are the facilities like, etc.
* *Weather:* Always an issue on a road trip, but when the road extends into Alaska during
  the start of the winter season, the matter of weather becomes more critical.
