My name is Chris Lott.  I'm a company owner, consultant, project manager and design engineer.  But most of all, I have a passion for engineering and problem solving.  In my 30+ years as an electronics engineer, I've traveled around the world many times, working with various engineering teams.  I've been based in Seoul since 2004,  but work with clients in Asia, America and Europe.  Some of my specialties are listed below.

- Embedded systems design
- Rapid prototyping and development
- Low- to medium- volume niche market production
- Re-design for obsolescent parts
- Video, set-top boxes, and closed captioning

Feel free to drop me a message if you have any questions or comment.
