As part of my ongoing effort to better organize my digital data, I've been using a Network Attached Storage (NAS) device for the past couple of years.  These are basically a standalone hard disk drive, typically with multiple drives configured as a RAID array, and connected to your local network by ethernet.  In my case, I have a Buffalo Linkstation Duo, model LS-WXL 682.  It came from the factory outfitted with two each one terabyte hard disk drives pre-configured as a RAID-0 array.

Initially I didn't fully grasp the subtle implications of it being RAID-0.  I knew I wasn't getting any error correction benefit, but in the back of my mind I was planning to eventually change out the drives with larger ones, and would reconfigure to RAID 1 at that point (this unit only has two drive bays, so other RAID techniques aren't possible). That time came last week, when two brand new four terabyte drives were tossed onto my doorstep over the front yard fence by a careless delivery man.  I can report that the drives passed this informal method of drop testing, and are currently spinning happily awwy. But getting to this point was a nightmare which was about to begin.
