## Pardon my Mess

One of my New Year's resolutions is to organize my blog and include a 
bunch of new material. One incentive is that I've started distributing 
business cards (or name cards for my Korean friends) which show my blog's
website.

So I sat down Sunday afternoon to do this, and immediately ran into a
bunch of unexpected issues.  I got way deeper into Jekyll than I really 
wanted to, but fighting it all day, I finally got it sorted out.
I am now focusing on the content rather than the tool.
