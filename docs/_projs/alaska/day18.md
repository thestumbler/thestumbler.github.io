The Eagle 83 and crew completed their mission today, landing in
[Fairbanks, Alaska](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairbanks,_Alaska){:target="_blank"}{% comment %}_{% endcomment %},
at a site they named Regency Fairbanks. This will be their temporary base of operations for the next few days.
After a mandatory rest period, the crew will begin a series of EVA explorations using the
Tundra Excursion Module (TEM), Samurai. The goal is to establish a permanent operational base
in the area known as
[North Pole, Alaska](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Pole,_Alaska){:target="_blank"}{% comment %}_{% endcomment %}.
Next will be to establish a communications center for better and more reliable communications.

After a couple more posts summarizing data from the expedition, updates will no longer be daily, 
but as major events unfold. Once Eagle 83 has established a permanent base station, I will hand
over this blog to Capt. Greg to manage as he sees fit.
