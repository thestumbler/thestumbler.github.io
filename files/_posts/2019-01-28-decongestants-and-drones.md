Just as the annual Korean [Drone show](http://eng.droneshowkorea.com/main/main.php)
in Busan arrived last week, The Stumbler's annual super sinus infection arrived.
The doctor prescribed six different medicines and told me to stay in bed for
three days, exactly the same three days of show. And he was right, I needed all 
three days to recover.

So unfortunately I missed the Drone show and seeing the exhibits of two of our 
local Sacheon companies.  Here's a quick summary.

## SAMCO

Two fellow Sacheon-based engineers, BM and AY, develop drones for SAMCO.
They have two facilities, both located in the Sacheon Industrial Park beside 
the South Sea estuary.  Here is their exhibit at the show.

Drones from their Duodrone family are based on a 2.2m wingspan
airframe and come in a variety of configurations.  They target several 
applications:

* Geographic Information Systems (GIS)
* Agriculture
* Surveillance
* Land Surveying / Mapping

## Kencoa

Another fellow Sacheon-based engineer, TJ, has been working on the Hybrid Smart
Drone project at Kencoa.  Here is their booth at the Drone show.

The model KEN-HSD 200 has a wing-span of 2.9m and is in production now.
Kencoa is also located in the Sacheon Industrial Park, just south of the 
Aerospace Museum.  And they are building a new facility further south
in the new Jongpo Industrial Park.
