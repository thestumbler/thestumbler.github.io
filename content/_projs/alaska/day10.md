Today Eagle 83 encountered the first snow storm of the mission; indeed, the first
seasonal snowstorm in this region of the galaxy. Captain Greg maintained 
a lower-than-planned velocity vector due to the intense intergalactic winds.
Fortunately by nightfall, the storm has subsided and things are back to normal.

Environmental controls in the command module failed to provide sufficient
heating today, so the crew has unpacked their warm EVA suits for the drive
tomorrow. Repair instructions from Command Post Kimchi will be uploaded to 
Eagle 83 soon, hopefully solving this issue.

The crew has fallen in love with a local franchise restaurant
[Tim Hortons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Hortons){:target="_blank"}{% comment %}_{% endcomment %},
which they say is a cross between Starbucks and Chick-fil-A.
Daily caloric requirements thus satisfied, the crew awaits another adventure tomorrow.
