[Christopher Columbus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Columbus){:target="_blank"} {% comment %}_{% endcomment %}
took seven years to prepare for his departure across the Atlantic Ocean.
[Capt. Meriwether Lewis and 2nd Lt. William Clark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_and_Clark_Expedition){:target="_blank"} {% comment %}_{% endcomment %}
took only six months to prepare for their Expedition.
Greg took two months, and only missed his targeted departure date by a few days.
Not bad, in comparison.

Today's route was primarily along [Interstate 22](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_22){:target="_blank"} {% comment %}_{% endcomment %}
which stretches from [Birmingham Alabama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham,_Alabama){:target="_blank"} {% comment %}_{% endcomment %}
to the outskirts of
[Memphis, Tennessee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memphis,_Tennessee){:target="_blank"} {% comment %}_{% endcomment %}.
Apparently this interstate was in the planning stages since I was in high school, but
took a long time to realize.  Construction started in 2005, and it was officially opened
in October 2015, a comfortable three years prior to Greg needing it on the first leg of 
his Alaskan adventure.
