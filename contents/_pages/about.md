My name is Chris Lott.  I'm a company owner, consultant, project manager and design engineer.  But most of all, I have a passion for engineering and problem solving.  In my 30+ years as an electronics engineer, I've traveled around the world many times, working with various engineering teams.  I've been based in South Korea since 2004, but work with clients in Asia, America and Europe.  

Here are some of my specialties:

- Embedded systems design
- Rapid prototyping and development
- Low- to medium- volume niche market production
- Re-design for obsolescent parts
- Video, set-top boxes, and closed captioning
