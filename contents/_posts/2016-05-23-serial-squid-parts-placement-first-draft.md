title: Serial Squid Parts Placement First Draft
description: maximum 155 char description

I finished the first draft of the Serial Squid PCB parts layout today.  It has been an adventure learning KiCAD's PCBNew tool, and fighting with the circular layout and angles of this board.  That will be the subject of a future post.

I'm going to revisit this layout in 2 days, and will probably straighten out a lot of those parts.  The connectors, of course, need to be at odd angles.  But after I've made this first pass at parts placement, I think most of the other parts can be at normal rotations of 0, 90, 180, or 270 without sacrificing the routing or appearance.  Look for a new post soon on the Serial Squid project page which will give an overview of the parts grouping.
