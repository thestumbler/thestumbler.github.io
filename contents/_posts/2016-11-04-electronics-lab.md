![New Consolidated Electronics Lab](/images/electronics-lab.jpg) 

Consolidation of three lab benches into one - complete. The secret? Throw away items you haven't used in over a year, fully realizing that one or two of them will suddenly be urgently needed next week. Throw away duplicate and broken tools. Store projects, debugging tools, supplies, etc., in containers. For me in Korea, these were large sized Lock-n-Lock kitchen containers. Be creative in making storage space. I put some shelves under the lab table at the very back to store all those containers. Make good use of storage bins, as you can see in this picture. Poke around on Google and YouTube to see how others have organized their labs for ideas. Next challenge? Keep it clean.
