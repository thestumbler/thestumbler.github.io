In the process of troubleshooting a broken controller, I decided to sketch the 
circuit schematic. It was a real fun exercise, seriously, and the results are below. 
Next post will be my guess at the theory of operation.  I already have figured
most of it out, but I want to make a few measurements before saying I fully
understand the circuit.
