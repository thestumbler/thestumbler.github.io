*Tiny FPGA arrived, and it is*


Last summer I had a long weekly commute, and listed to a lot of podcasts.
One particular [Amphour](https://theamphour.com/395-an-interview-with-luke-valenty/) podcast
featured Luke Valenty and his [Tiny FPGA](https://tinyfpga.com) project.
I finally got around to ordering a couple of weeks ago.  
Now I have to come up with a creative FPGA project...
