Now that the new controller is up and running, there is one final item
to consider - train detection.  There are two methods commonly employed.
One is a reed relay activated by a magnet mounted on the engine.  The other
is an infrared detector mounted under the tracks.  My friend opted for 
the latter, and he got the [Heathcote IRDOT](https://heathcote-electronics.co.uk/irdot1.html)
units [(pdf-manual)](/myfiles/modelrr/irdot-manual.pdf).

How do I know? Well, there was an installation issue.  These come with 
the IR transmitter and receiver mounted directly on the circuit board.
It is intended to be installed flush against the bottom of the model
railroad base, as shown in this sketch:

In case the base is too thick, you have to remove them from the circuit
board and install an extension cable (you can see the extension wires
installed in the picture below). I agreed to help out, and add these extensions.
In the process of doing that, I was curious how this thing worked. 
So I hooked it up on the bench for some probing.

## Theory of Operation

![irdot-schematic](/images/modelrr/irdot-sch.png)
*IRDOT Schematic*

#### Semiconductors

The IRDOT has only a handful of semiconductor components:

  * Transistor, NPN, BC337
  * Diode, Zener 11V, BZX-55C-11
  * Diode, Signal, 1N4148
  * IC Analog, Quad op-amp (Texas Instruments LM324)
  * Diode IR emitter, (Fairchild QEC112 or similar)
  * Transistor IR detector, (Fairchild QSC112 or similar)

#### Power supply

The circuit of Q1 generates a regulated 11VDC signal. It operates in the standard
emitter-follower, zener-controlled regulator configuration.  The regulated voltage
is used to power the op-amps, and is available off-board for accessories via pin #3.

#### Oscillator 

Op-amp U1B forms a standard comparator-based 
[relaxation oscillator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relaxation_oscillator#Comparatorâ€“based_electronic_relaxation_oscillator)
My quick back-of-the-envelope calculation shows the oscillating frequency should be around
3.8 kHz.  The actual measured frequency was 2.9 kHz.  Close enough for this casual analysis.

#### Virtual Ground

Op-amp U2A generates a virtual ground mid-way between ground and the regulated 11 VDC rail,
using R19/R20 voltage divider and filter cap C6.


#### Preamp, AGC, and Integrator (incomplete)

Op-amp U2C acts as the IR sensor preamp. 
As a quick guess, it looks like U2D provides some kind of AGC, with a 
time constant set by R16 / C15.
U2B is a high-pass filter.
The pulses then build up a charge on integrating cap C2.
Or, more accurately, remove charge from C2, since the pulses coming from U2B
will be negative (wrt the virtual ground).
When the IR emitter isn't transmitting, a charge is built-up on C2 via D4/R7.
(*I haven't measured this yet, I'm just guessing from eyeballing the schematic*).

#### Detector and Output

U1C forms the detector, and U2D provides active high output buffering,
and Q2 provides active low buffering.

#### Unused

Op-amp U1A is unused.
